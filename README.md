# DOA-Deep-Learning-Autoencoder
This project is created in 2021.12.7

Contents
Use Autoencoder based on deel learning framework to denoise the sample covariance matrix.
Then the denoised sample covariance matrix is then used to perform Direction of Arrival estimation.

Based on the papers, DAE based DOA can handle signals at low SNRs and enhance the insensitivity of the
array system to the imperfections.
